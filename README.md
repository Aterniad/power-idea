# power-idea

This is how I've tried to remake famous <a href="https://github.com/JoelBesada/activate-power-mode">Atom Activate-Power-Mode plugin</a> for IntelliJ IDEA products.

Well, first version is ready, but it's only can spread some particles.

I'm trying now to make simple configuration panel and screen shaking so you can help me ;)

You can download first version here: https://yadi.sk/d/sQfQkoZimtGXF
I've tested this on IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition and PHPStorm 9.

How to enable: right-click on your code and choose "Toggle Epic Code" option.
